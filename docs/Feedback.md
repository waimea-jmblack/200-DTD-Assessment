# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> James, there is very little evidence in your documentation... 
> - Designs for page layouts?
> - Testing of the site actaully work?

> It's not really possible for me to give you a pass on this with these things missing?

> Do you not have other screenshots of your interface design? Can you not make a quick video of you testing your system?




## System Requirements	

- [x] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [x] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [x] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [x] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome

> Done ok


## Database Structure	

- [x] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

> The design shown in the docs is not what the final database looked like. I have sighted the final design


## Front-End UI Designs

- [ ] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.

> Very little evidence of the design process. There are a couple of images of designs in the docs, but they show little of the key pages.


## System Testing

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> There is no real evidence of system testing, showing posts being added to the system, DB being updated, etc.  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **E** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  


## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ ] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ ] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

> Comments...  


## Review and Evaluation

- [x] **M** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome

> Done ok
