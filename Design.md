## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

The need/problem that this website needs to solve is that the end user needs to pool all their data that they need to run the website, to one area. This makes the end users life easier.

### End-User Requirements

To gather the information of the acidity of the soil, What regions of blenheim are being irrigated at the moment, client hoticulture and the annul grape harvest. With also being a hub that links to the weather websites. 

I.e. We have the website set up to be able to pool data that is supplied by the end user, then the website calculates the average and then puts the averaged data into a graph that tracks the trend of how much grapes have been harvested.
