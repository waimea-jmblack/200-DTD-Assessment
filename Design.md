# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **VINEYARD DATA WEBSITE**

Project Author: **JAMES BLACK**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

To gather information about the acidity of the soil, what regions of Blenheim are being irrigated now, client horticulture and the annual grape harvest. With also has a hub that links to weather websites.    
I.e., We have the website set up to be able to pool data that is supplied by the end user, then the website calculates the average and then puts the averaged data into a graph that tracks the trend of how many grapes have been harvested.  

### Identified Need or Problem

The main underlying problem that the end user has is that they must go through a dozen websites every Monday morning to find the average weather patterns for the next couple of days. This also includes other prospects like the acidity of the soil 

### End-User Requirements



### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

## Relevant Implications

Functionality
Aesthetic

### Functionality

The relevant implication of functionality talks about how the website is functional to the end user. An example of this is asking the question, does the website do what the end user intended? 

This implication is relevant to the project because if the website is not functional or not completing its tasks to the fullest, then the website will become obsolete. 

I need to consider the fact that there are a lot of intended features that are going to be on this website that i am creating, this means that i might not be able to get all the intended features that i am wanting to add, onto the website. 



### Aesthetic

The relevant implication that I have picked for this part of the topic is Aesthetic. Aesthetics refers to the design and appeal of the website through the choice of colour, font, design and more. 

The Aesthetics implication is relevant to the topic/website because when creating the website, we must consider what the end users want the website to be. Functionality and Aesthetics both must be present for the website to make the end user appreciate the work and effort put into it whilst being a user-friendly website. 

I need to consider the colour palette, the font, and the overall design of the website. This is because if the design of the website is not getting the point across to the end user, that this website is about keeping all the vineyard and region data in one area, then the end user might think that this website is not worth their time and effort.
