## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 16/05/2024

In DrawSQL, I am working on V1 the wire frame for the Vineyard Website  

I am working on creating a layout for the website. This will be done by having the home page as the hub to get to various parts of the website.  
Flow chart one is my first version of the wire frame without any input by the end user.

Flow chart two is my revamped design of flow chart one. I did this because i wanted to make sure I have a thought-out design, before I show this to my end user to get their honest feedback.
