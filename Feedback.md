# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> James, you have some holes to fill here. If you leave sections incomplete, you will never get round to doing them and will fail - time to get it all done!

> We're five weeks into this project now - should really be up-to-date and there should be evidence of your designs, DB, etc.


## System Requirements	

- [x] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [ ] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome

> The end-user section needs to be completed - See the exemplars for what this should contain

> Proposed solution - this needs to be done! See exemplar - should be a list of features / functions the system will have

> The implications need to detail what you must consider whilst you are designing and developing your outcome. You have generally done this, but... 
> - Functionality - you must make sure every part of the system works (i.e. it is functional)
> - Usability - This is an essential implication. Please see the exemplar and get into the details of Nielsen's heuristics, etc.


## Database Structure	

- [ ] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

> Where is your DB design? Should really be done by now


## Front-End UI Designs

- [ ] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.

> Comments...


## System Testing

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> Comments...  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **E** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  


## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ ] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ ] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

> Comments...  


## Review and Evaluation

- [ ] **M** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome

> Comments...
